# redux-road
learnt the core redux concept building game

This was the project on codecademy with clear directions, I followed the directions and instructions and build it.

In this project I built an adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. The state represented, well, the state of the game. It contains the player’s inventory, distance travelled, and time on the road. Each event in the game is represented as an action. Players can gather supplies, travel, and–if they play risky–sometimes tip over the wagon carrying their supplies.
